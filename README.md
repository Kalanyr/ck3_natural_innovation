# Natural Cultural Tech Era / Innovation Progression for# Harem Doctrines For CK3 / Crusader Kings III version 1.5.*+ aka khd aka ck3_harem_doctrines_updated
 1.8. aka kni aka ck3_natural_innovation
A simple mod that removes the year requirement for unlocking Eras.  (Actually sets the year requirement to 1 for Early Medieval/High Medieval/Late Medieval , for technical reasons.)  

NB - Paradox made a decent effort at improving the Era unlocking problem disabling Decisions but it's still borked for Varangian Adventurers (which is not added to Norse culture if Tribal and Early Medieval have the same start date), so this mod remains unchanged (Tribal Era Unlock = Year 0, Other Eras = Year 1).
